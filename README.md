### Code Discription:

#### Search
 * The Search object provides four methods to search for an integer in an array of integers.
 * The first two methods are linear search algorithms, one of which is optimized for performance.
 * The last two methods are binary search algorithms, one of which is optimized for performance.
 
 * The linear search algorithms iterate through the array and compare each element to the search term.
 * The first algorithm returns a tuple of the found value and its index, or a string indicating that the value could not be found.
 * The second algorithm uses the `find` method to return a tuple of the found value and its index, or a string indicating that the value could not be found.
 
 * The binary search algorithms assume that the array is sorted and use a divide-and-conquer approach to find the search term.
 * The first algorithm returns a tuple of the found value and its index, or a string indicating that the value could not be found.
 * The second algorithm uses the `binarySearch` method to return a tuple of the found value and its index, or a string indicating that the value could not be found.
 
 * @note All methods return an `Any` type, which is not recommended for production code.
 * @note The `linear_noCheatCode` and `binary_noCheatCode` methods use mutable variables, which is not recommended for functional programming.
